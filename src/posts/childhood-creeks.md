TODO: add images, abstract, nature, but also digital?

We lived by the creek. We built huts out of woven sticks and "hay" collected from the piles left over after the grass of the football field was cut. We tried to stay out of the wars of sticks that occasionally were fought in the outskirts of the school grounds. We grew older, but kept building and exploring. At some point we stopped.

I, and I handful of childhood friends, kept together. We found each other as early as kindergarden, and even then, we always played right outside the fences. We kept close, only crossing the small bike road to look at ladybug larva that crawled under leaves pestered by aphids. Even that felt dangerous -- like we were a bit too far. The rest of the time we spent crawling through bushes or climbing trees. For some reason, the kindergarden staff let us. It was not like we sneaked out in secret. They trusted us.

We went to roughly the same schools as we grew older, and until our young teens, we kept doing what we did. We built intricate rooms and paths in ditches and cramped glades, we created outposts on the shore of the large creek that went by our school (we're now a bit older, kindergarden left behind).

At some point, we transitioned to bridges, and as soon as we did, we were stuck. Bridges, and later, dams, was what we did. Once again, we hung around just outside school grounds, sometimes a few hundred meters up the creek, nearby a large pond in the direction of the forest (although, this was now less cool: we were old enough to be trusted and the teachers wouldn't be able to keep track anyway, and all the kids were doing it). 

Our bridges started small but grew more intricate. We used large logs, sticks and construction debree. Planks, rope and pallets were gold. Soon, our bridges could easily support as many as would fit. We started using plansk and weaves of sticks packed with hay to block the flow of water. We managed to create a difference in water level of several decimeters (I will stick to SI units in this post, I'm sorry). We found pride in this, for some reason, until we realized the hay was actually killing small fish that were unable to pass. We found them scattered around. Feeling guilty, we constructed a paths for the fish with a traffic cone [WHAT WAS IT CALLED, THAT THING?], and I could swear I saw one sweep by, and with it all our guilt.

We kept going.

Heavy rains caused heavy floods, for us and for all the other kids who built their homes by the creek. At one point, what felt like half the school came chanting at us, telling us the flood was our fault. We tried to explain that the water level was *higher* in the pond upstream -- that's where the water gathered and that sustained the high water levels -- but the kids wouldn't listen. We tore down our dam as quickly as possible. When the flood withdrew, we rebuilt. 

Occasionally, half the school would fight. People picked up sticks and started fencing. Most of us stayed out of these fights, with an exception of one or two of my friends. I never wanted to participate. I couldn't conceptualize fighting, or if I could, I couldn't conceptualize fighting *them all*. The *stick wars* was like a force. You avoided it until it was over.

Then we kept working. I loved this world. I think we all did. Never fully care free, I remember when we got threatening messages from other groups of kids. There we're cold wars about land and materials. But mostly, it was exploration, creation and community. A place of our own, labor of love.

One evening, at some after school activity, there was power shovels (excavators?) by our camp. They were digging up the entire ditch where our current base was set up. Horrified, I contacted my friends and we moved as much material as possible to a new (way too nearby) location. We had lost a lot. Our next creation was a haphazard anti-camp that would collapse automatically (by design) if unwanted visitors treaded the grounds. Not a real base. Soon the construction creeped closer, anyway, and we had to move. *Fuck it*, we said, and moved all our materials all the way across the football field -- a huge distance, then. As far away as possible from the construction. Here, we would be safe.

But the camp was not the same. Most of the time, we just sat in the trees on our logs. We loved it there, too, but we had no bridge, no dam. The building was not the same, not quite.

At some point, the construction started on that side of the football field as well, but I can't remember if that was when we still went to that school, or after. Something had happened, way before that. We stopped building.

I remember, when we all had cell phones, all my friends wanted to play mobile games on the breaks, instead of building or playing. The transition just happened. It wasn't because of the mobile games -- that was just another way of spending the time; we had stopped playing for other reasons.

I still don't know what they are.

More and more of our lives became digital. And I'm not blaming the transition to the digital for our loss of innocence, our sense of play or will to explore. I guess I blame our parents, our teachers, or the internet itself. We didn't have the tools to properly explore explore the internet. We couldn't make stuff, we understood nothing. All we could do was play flash games, and later, other video games. Sure, we explored on a few predetermined (allowed) sites, but here the boundries were strange. 

Not until much later have I began to understand what can be found on the internet, the beauty in finding geo-cities-esque websites, of finding the art or poetry of a lonely user far away from search engines. Of building something similar for someone maybe to find. I'm starting to love this world, although it's not the same love, not the same wonder. Guess nothing really beats being a kid.

Our bridge building had a magical resurgance after my family and I moved to a new apartment. The new apartment was close to the school, and really close to the creek, just a few hundred meters downstream. The entire area was under construction, but there still was a large portions of bushy fields and groves nearby. My friends and I pretty soon found a new spot along a small trail, in a no-mans-land between intersections and residential areas. Here, the creek was even wider, before it disappeared completely into concrete tubes under the city.

Due to the construction all around (new, fancy blocks and apartment complexes on the way) there was lots of debree to be found. We build the largest bridge yet, an entire platform with an adhoc roof, and large plywood planks to dam up the water. It was beautiful. We even used some material from the old school huts.

This was now an after school activity. Some of my friends even went there alone, worked on the project in the evening when no-one else was there.

We shared the space with a beaver.

For some reason it found itself this close to town. We noticed fallen trees, pieces of barque. At one point, we noticed a strange amount of mud in the water, and we followed it upstream. Movements, under the surface. A black tail, then nothing, silence and stillness. At another time, my brother and I encountered it. The beaver was just... there. Unbothered by us. We walked beside it as it slowly swam down the creek. When it encountered our dam, it jumped up to the side, and down on the other side. It then disappeared into the concrete tubing.

We could almost touch it.

A few days later it had made a hole in the dam. Understandable. We took the hint.

A while later our entire project was removed. All the material was thrown to the side of the creek. Construction had started nearby. It was over.

That was the last of it. We were too old for this anyway.

Not sure if that childhood was so pure. Even though we loved exploring, being in nature, there was an obvious aspect of asserting ourselves over nature. Of control. We changed the flow of water, and found pride in that. We were kids, we weren't respectful. We certainly only caused harm to the surrounding ecosystem.

But I still miss it. I do believe part of us are wired around nature. We feel at home in the woods. An open field produces calm. This not only is escape from city life (which I do love, too, but in a completely different way), it's also that inherently produces good feelings in us.

Recently, I've had a desire to explore again. Mostly the city, but nearby nature as well. However, there's another aspect to it now. I have a hard time envisioning myself exploring the city or nearby nature without a camera. Without documentation. Without the idea of sharing my findings in the back of my mind.

Maybe this is an unavoidable shift. I'm a lot more intertwined now. Aware of my connection to other, of my place in the city, on the internet. I'm just sad that so much has gone from experience to aesthetics.

I was inspired to write this piece after I read [a lesson about swamps for tables in 35 parts](https://tilde.town/~vilmibm/swamp/) by *vilmibm*. I applaud his resistance, however minor, and I wonder why my friends and I didn't even consider it. Why we saw unwanted change, change we didn't understand, and didn't even formulate the idea of resisting.

I'm glad I'm more aware of this option, now. Resisting societal shifts, and shifts within myself. It sometimes feel pointless and hopeless but I intend to power through these surges of apathy. I'm feeling such a surge this very moment, but I'll keep writing these words.

I haven't thought about this part of my childhood in a while, not properly. It felt good to return. It felt like I was re-asserting something that belonged to me. Refreshed the memory of an experience.
