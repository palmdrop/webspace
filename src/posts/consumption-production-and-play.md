I've lost all sense of pacing. I want to do everything but I can only do nothing. There's resistance, desire, and shame. This post is a semi-structured stream of thoughts about creativity, happiness, cultural drives, and play. These thoughts will hopefully be developed in future posts.

Take some clichés:
* shrinking attention spans
* a tech-ravaged youth
* and a world on speed.

Good old *boomer* clichés, but we know them to hold some truth. Everything is moving too fast to parse. Internet culture is a hivemind no one person can keep up with. Ads are always in the periphery. We know we're not immune to influence. Neuroplasticity is discussed along with productivity-boosting, undoing bad habits, and dopamine detoxes, indicating that we are in control. But neuroplasticity also makes us malleable. Our brains will change around the digital culture we engage in, and we know that we ~~probably~~ are being manipulated, constantly. 

Even if we could identify exactly what was happening, we wouldn't know how to fix it, or even if we'd want to. Everything's so streamlined, optimized, hypervivid -- all so fun and endlessly pleasurable. You want it, I want it.

I'm not satisfied with the state of my mind. At age twenty-five, my thoughts are scattered, my reading shallow, my ideas vague. This is supposed to be my mental peak, when I excel. And, unfortunately, this is also when my brain settles into its lasting shape. Of course, plasticity never goes away, but the mind becomes less elastic with age. I highly dislike this. I want lucidity, I want to have meaningful thoughts and deep conversations, I want to accomplish something, professionally and privately. Why I want this is not completely obvious to me, but I know I *should* want this. 

And I sense a similar discontent in my friends, in my coworkers, and on the Internet in general -- there's no end to the youtube guys trying to address this discontent.

Let's briefly talk about production and consumption: strong economic forces that, thanks to the Internet, have taken new forms. Production and consumption alike become abstract, automatic, and self-evident. Production/consumption is what we do and are, not only when working or shopping, but whenever we interact on the Internet. These drives are part of us. We consume endless digital content (and with it, ads) and we constantly produce/perform/create while online. A lot of people ping-pong between these two modes: they consume TikToks or youtube videos or Instagram images, and then they append their own *content*, maybe with distant dreams about recognition, virality, fame, or some other end goal.  

Our brains will, consciously or unconsciously, adapt to the cultural drives that control this space -- and this is where young people live, hyper exposed. Raw algorithmic content consumption, microtransactions, app-facilitated product/service consumption; and endless production of tweets, TikTok's, and memes. *Classical* work/consumption is second class. What we want is to live on the Internet. There, everything is more tangible.

I think the state of the Internet may account for the brain fog I and others experience, and the connected dissatisfaction we feel. When production/consumption is everything, of course, we're dissatisfied when we can't meaningfully engage or create -- or when we don't see the results we should expect. I'm too distracted, I jump between tasks, I scan the feed, and then I feel shame, or jealousy, or greed even, because I'm not what I could be, I'm not creating -- not producing.

Hate to talk about happiness -- another cliché, isn't it? -- but here goes: we seem to know, intellectually, that neither consumption nor production will make us happy. Money, or the pursuit of it, does not necessarily result in satisfaction. Instead, I think happiness (or satisfaction, or meaning, or whatever) comes from play. Play: *unproductive* behaviors performed only for the sake of the behavior itself -- no external reward, no long-term goal, just enjoyment. Casual gaming, casual board games, sports for fun; music, *jamming with the boys*, nonsense conversations with friends at parties; experimental artistic creation, lazy art. These are some pointless activities, a wonderful waste of time -- lovely and casual and fun.

Play is at our core. It seems to have evolutionary benefits. No surprise, most animals engage in it, even as grown-ups. But our current cultural drives, those that permeate the Internet, seem to either counteract play or paint it in a bad light. Either, fundamentally playful activities are marketized, or they are disregarded as childish, *pointless*, dumb.

I find it hard to play. Often, I feel stuck -- snared. Some days I'm unable to play at all. Maybe most days. I wake up in the morning with this passive (but constant) feeling of stress, of shortcomings, of time wasted. Something inside me wants me to hurry along, force me to get going, to do *something*. This may be a Saturday. I may have the entire day to spend however I like. This is when I'd *want* to work on my projects -- i.e, not play. But whenever I try to do something *productive*, it just feels like labor, not like creativity, not like art. I want to make something meaningful, but for some reason, resistance slows me down, driving me to consume. When I intentionally try to play instead -- the piano, a video game or try out some silly, pointless ideas -- the stress returns, driving me away. 

Even when we seemingly succeed at playing, performance is in the back of our minds. Either we want to beat our friends in the game at hand, or we have ideas of going pro: climbing the ranks, competing in the nationals, earning money. When truly playing, goals like that are not present. The activity is the goal and the purpose. We're in the zone.

I want to learn how to get there.

We'll always need to perform, to move forward. I suppose. But it shouldn't be all we are. It should not be our default. I don't want to allow the drives to produce and consume seep so deep inside of me that I cannot do anything else. If that happens, I don't think I can ever be happy.

Solutions, I don't have. Leaving social media may help, but the results will probably be limited, and it's not always practical. The cultural drives are rooted deeper, anyway: they are expressed by all discourse, all media. In the way, we talk about work, spare time, art, and the future.

My goal is to find calm contentment in the every day, in the casual projects I care about, in play, experimentation, caring, everything neither mindless nor too self-conscious. I want to *waste* time and find that time well spent. [Some say you have to know how to waste time to truly make art.](https://mladenstilinovic.com/works/10-2) But changing current defaults requires clear intention and dedication. Slipping back into production/consumption is always easier. Therefore, I shall consciously pursue play. Play is release.

To truly enjoy play we need a way to avoid the traps of capitalist culture, global media companies with infinite data collection capabilities, and an Internet culture that has been slowly perverted. We cannot properly control our minds and desires if all our interactions are being monetized. The algorithms steering social networks, search engines, and data collection companies are not human: they do not want what's best for us, they're created to generate profit and will (by design or by accident) exploit all psychological weakness to do so. 

So, find other digital spaces. Other things to enjoy. Try to find pleasure in time wasted. Explore and play. I'm hoping to start learning this.
