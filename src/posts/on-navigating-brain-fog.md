The purpose of this blog is intentionally unclear. I want to share thoughts, ideas, and things I create. Most of all, I want to force myself to think and explore more deeply. Time will tell how this goes. Everything is under construction, always.

I started a blog over at [palmdrop.github.io](https://palmdrop.github.io) using a static website builder called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I made a few posts explaining the techniques I employ when creating generative art. Then the blog died, and I did other things for a while. But my interest in web design, digital art, and the Internet did not falter. Eventually, I decided to build this site -- a webspace of my own, where I could upload living instances of my generative art and share whatever I found interesting.

And so, why not build a blog as well? I still have the desire to write. I want to force myself to formulate my thoughts. Often, I find myself stuck in brain fog if I don't. Everything is too ethereal and abstract unless I spend time structuring, writing, and developing. Maybe someone will find what I write interesting. If not, I do not mind. This space is for me.

My first posts will likely be copies of my old posts, ported to this site. To make sure everything works. 

Hopefully, more will come.
