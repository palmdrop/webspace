In our huts, we spent most of our spare time. As we grew older, our projects became larger and more complex. At some point, we stopped.</p>
<hr>
<p>This post is me reminiscing on parts of my childhood.  I have no particular goal either than for me to explore memories, old joys, and any related ideas I might encounter. I rarely think of these times. It feels good to return, although I know my recollections most certainly are selective and idealized. </p>
<hr>
<p>A handful of childhood friends and I stuck together for a long time. We found each other in kindergarten. Even then, we often played outside the fences. We stayed nearby, only exploring the most adjacent trees and bushes, only crossing the small bike road to look at the ladybug larva that lived under the aphid-pestered leaves. The rest of the time we crawled through holes in the fences, through paths in the bushes, and climbed the trees. It was not like we sneaked out in secret,  but no one stopped us. We were trusted.</p>
<p>As we grew older, we went to roughly the same schools. During breaks, we built intricate huts, rooms, and passageways in the ditches and cramped glades. We constructed outposts at the edge of the large creek that went by our school. We created spaces of our own and kept doing it until our early teens.</p>
<p>For a long time, we were obsessed with walls and roofs -- we wanted our creations to have an isolated interior, we wanted the spaces to be rainproof, protected. We learned how to create ad hoc weaves of elastic sticks and ropes we found laying around. We then patched all the holes in the structure with &quot;hay&quot; collected from the piles of cut-up grass that was left behind when the lawnmowers had mowed the football field. The insides of our structures became completely dark and deprived of oxygen. We crawled in the mud. Occasionally, mold would take hold in the hay and we&#39;d have to transport the infected material out. The air would go white with powdered hay and spores. Probably not healthy at all.</p>
<p>At some point, we transitioned to building bridges. The creek was wide enough for this to pose a real challenge. But with the right material, we managed. Bridges, and later, dams, was what we did. Once again, we spent most of our time on the outskirts of the school grounds, sometimes a couple of hundred meters upstream, nearby a large pond towards the forest.</p>
<p>(Here&#39;s a tangent about that pond. It&#39;s winter, but the ice is fragile. One of my friends is walking across the pond alone, jumping over cracks. For some reason, half the school is there, and all the kids are cutting at the edges of the ice with sticks and rocks. They wanted it to break. Soon my friend jumped between sinking sheets of ice. He managed to get to shore without falling into the water. A strange experience. Could have ended badly. Why did all the children want to see him fall in?) </p>
<p>Our bridges grew more intricate. Soon, they could easily support as many kids as would fit. This is when we started to use planks and hay to block the flow of water. We could raise the water level by several decimeters.  We found pride in this, until we realized that small fish got stuck in the hay, and died. Feeling guilty, we made paths for fish to pass. I could swear I saw one sweep by, and with that, all our guilt was swept away too, even though our solution was half-hearted at best. </p>
<p>We kept going.</p>
<p><img src="/img/creek/grass.jpg" alt="grass"></p>
<p>Heavy rains caused heavy floods. At one point, a bunch of kids gathered at the edge of our bridge, screaming that the flooding was our fault. We tried to explain that the water level was higher in the dam upstream -- that&#39;s where the water was coming from -- but they wouldn&#39;t listen. We tore down our dam as quickly as possible. When the flood withdrew, we rebuilt.</p>
<p>All in all, we loved this world. I think the bridges, or huts, or whatever we built, gave us a sense of home. Of belonging. We had a space of our own. If all we did would have been exploring, playing in new places each day, maybe we would have felt more at home in the general landscape, but we probably wouldn&#39;t have had the same sense of belonging. We had spaces we could go to and just <em>be</em>. Spaces we made ourselves, as a labor of love. </p>
<hr>
<p>One day, excavators dug up our camp. A new bike road was to be made. Horrified, we moved as much material as possible to a new location. Soon, we had to move again, as the construction crept closer. <em>Fuck it</em> we said, and moved all our materials across the football field. A huge distance, as far away as possible. Here, we would be safe.</p>
<p>But the camp was not the same. Most of the time, we just sat in the trees. We loved it there, too, but we had no bridge, no dam. The project was not the same, not quite.</p>
<p>At some point, the construction started on that side of the football field as well, but I can&#39;t remember if that happened much later, when we all went to other schools. It doesn&#39;t matter: something had happened, way before that. We had phones now. We played mobile games. We stopped building. </p>
<hr>
<p>More and more of our lives became digital. I&#39;m not blaming this for our loss of innocence, but as the internet took over as our main area of play, something fundamentally changed. To us, exploring the internet was not like exploring the woods or the creek. We didn&#39;t have the tools to properly explore the internet. We couldn&#39;t make stuff, we didn&#39;t know how anything worked. The boundaries were strict (enforced by schools and parents) and to us, arbitrary.</p>
<p>Not until fairly recently have I begun to understand the beauty in exploring the internet -- discovering small communities, personal web pages, knowledge sharing, experiments, art, and writing. I have the tools necessary to contribute and understand. However, although wonderful, I rarely experience the same sense of awe, enjoyment, and belonging as I did by the creeks. I guess nothing beats being a kid.</p>
<p>Even, well, even now, the internet is ethereal. Unknowable. Strange. I love it, but it&#39;s eerie. </p>

<p>Our desire to build bridges had a magical resurgence when my family and I moved to a new apartment close to the creek. We now lived a few hundred meters downstream from our old school. The entire neighborhood was under construction, but there were still large areas of bushy fields and groves nearby. My friends and I soon found a new spot beside a narrow trail, close to the water -- a no-mans-land between intersections and residential areas. Here, the creek flowed even wider, right before it disappeared into the concrete tubes below the city.</p>
<p>Thanks to the construction all around, there was lots of debris to be found. We created our largest bridge/dam yet, an entire platform made out of plywood, planks, logs, and pallets, with a small roof made of tarp. It was beautiful. We even reused some material from our old school projects.</p>
<p>Soon we realized we shared the space with a beaver.</p>
<p>We noticed pieces of bark and fallen trees. At one point, there was a strange amount of mud in the water, and movements under the surface. A scaly tail emerged, disappeared, and then nothing but silence. On another occasion, my brother and I got a closer look: the beaver just appeared, suddenly, unbothered by us. We walked beside it as it slowly swam downstream. When it encountered our dam, it jumped up on land, then down the other side, and hurried into the concrete tubes. I never saw it again, but a while later it had gnawed a large hole in our dam. We took the hint.</p>
<p>Once again, construction crept closer. We returned one day to find our entire project removed -- reduced to a pile of debris on the side of the creek. It was over. That was the last of it. We were too old for this, anyway.</p>
<hr>
<p>I don&#39;t think this part of our childhood was so pure. We loved exploring, spending time in the woods or the fields or by the creek, but we also asserted ourselves over nature. We wanted control, in a way. We changed the flow of water, and we were proud. We had no respect. We certainly only caused harm to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Still, I miss it. We humans seem to be wired for nature. We feel at home in the woods. It&#39;s not just an escape from the rush of city life (which I love, too, in a completely different way): nature also inherently makes us feel good.</p>
<p>Recently, I&#39;ve had a desire to explore again. Mostly the city, but nearby woods and cliffs as well. However, there&#39;s another aspect to it now. I have a hard time envisioning myself exploring anything without a camera. If I&#39;m not documenting, the trip would feel pointless. Wasteful. Although I love photography and I want to share what I make, this also makes me feel corrupted. Like I&#39;ve lost the ability to feel some fundamental joy.</p>
<p>Maybe this is an unavoidable shift. I&#39;m a lot more intertwined with my surroundings now, compared to when I was a kid. I&#39;m aware of my connection to others, of my place in the city, on the internet. I&#39;m just sad that so much has gone from experience to aesthetics.</p>

I applaud his resistance, however minor, and I ask myself why my friends and I didn&#39;t even consider it -- resistance. When faced with the destruction of our projects, when faced with change we didn&#39;t understand, we didn&#39;t ask questions or formulate ideas about fighting back.</p>
<p>I&#39;m glad I&#39;m more aware of this option, now. Resisting societal shifts, and shifts within myself. </p>
<hr>
<p>It was a while since I thought about this part of my childhood. Feels good to return -- like I&#39;m re-establishing some part of myself.</p>
