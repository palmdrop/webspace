    `
    I here gather web-based generative art pieces. And, in time, other experiments. I enjoy exploring
    aesthetics, algorithms and digital visuals. Generative techniques allow me to procedurally generate
    my works.
    `,
    `
    The core idea is to bring these pieces directly to the web. Mediated through third-party platforms,
    the piece becomes mere documentation. Videos, or still images. No interactivity. They are also
    stripped away from me and added to the content-pool of some corporate platform. 
    `,
    `
    In this space, I can present my work as it is, living and imperfect. There may be bugs.
