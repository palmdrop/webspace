# OBSCURED - PERSONAL WEBSPACE

**Live at** [palmdrop.site](https://palmdrop.site)

Obscured is my personal web site project. The site is multi-purpose. I (will) use it for
1. learning about web design, web apps, webgl and 3D on the web
1. exploring how we could be using the web
1. creating and showcasing generative art
1. blogging

and various other things.

The idea is to follow the principle of learning in the open. This site is unfinished and probably broken. I might push changes that are not in their final state. Instead of keeping everything behind closed door until it's polished and presentable, things will be public while in development. The aspiration is also to document my process and present my findings, solutions and thoughts in this readme or in the blog section (WIP).

I would also like to create something that pushes the internet and digital spaces in a sensible direction. There's many problems with how we use the internet today, and the direction in which we are moving. I hope to elaborate on this in a future post.

The complete source code is published here for all to see. Feel free to glean what you like. If you like, give me credit where credit is due. Or not. 

**Generative art** can mostly be found under ["Pieces"](https://palmdrop.site/pieces). Recently, I've mostly been experimenting with 3D.

## README/Blog backlog
Things I'd like to document.

* Solution for changing color themes using scss and css variables.
* Routing using react-router.
* Lazy loading for pages and images.
* Simple shader builders.
* Deploying using github actions.
